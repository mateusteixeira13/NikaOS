# Nika Kernel

**Nika** is an open-source operating system kernel inspired by Linux and the OSDev community, following design philosophies similar to Unix/Linux systems.

It is **fully free software**, allowing modification and redistribution without restrictions. Nika is designed as a platform for **experimentation, low-level development, and learning** about operating system internals, with a strong focus on clarity, control, and hands-on kernel development.
